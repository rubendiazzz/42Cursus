## Description

Welcome to my Campus 42 Projects repository! Here you will find all the projects I have developed during my time at Campus 42. Each project has its own folder with a detailed README file explaining the project's requirements, my approach, and the skills I have acquired.

## Projects

The Libft project is a standard C library that includes many useful functions that are not included in the standard C library. It includes functions for manipulating strings, memory, and other common data types.

### Printf

The Printf project is an implementation of the printf function in C. It includes support for many of the common format specifiers, such as %d, %s, and %f.

### Get Next Line

The Get Next Line project is a function that reads lines from a file descriptor. It is useful for reading large files or for reading files that are being updated in real-time.

### Born2beRoot

The Born2beRoot project is a system administration project that involves setting up a virtual machine and configuring various system settings. It includes tasks such as setting up a firewall, configuring network settings, and setting up user accounts.
