### :page_facing_up: Get Next Line

Get Next Line is a function that reads lines from a file descriptor. It is useful for reading large files or for reading files that are being updated in real-time.

### :lock: Born2beRoot

Born2beRoot is a system administration project that involves setting up a virtual machine and configuring various system settings. It includes tasks such as setting up a firewall, configuring network settings, and setting up user accounts.

### :wrench: Pipex

Pipex is a sophisticated program that emulates the shell command pipeline's functionality. It ingeniously accepts two file names and two commands along with their arguments. The output from the initial command serves as the input for the subsequent command, creating a seamless pipeline between two processes.

**Grade: Pending Evaluation** :hourglass:
