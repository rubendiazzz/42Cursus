### Libft :books:

Libft is a standard C library that includes many useful functions that are not included in the standard C library. It includes functions for manipulating strings, memory, and other common data types.

**Grade: 125/100** :trophy:

**Grade: 100/100** :trophy:

### Get Next Line :page_facing_up:

Get Next Line is a function that reads lines from a file descriptor. It is useful for reading large files or for reading files that are being updated in real-time.

### Born2beRoot :lock:

Born2beRoot is a system administration project that involves setting up a virtual machine and configuring various system settings. It includes tasks such as setting up a firewall, configuring network settings, and setting up user accounts.

### Pipex :wrench:

Pipex is a program that simulates the functionality of the shell command pipeline. It takes two file names as arguments and two commands with their arguments. The output of the first command is used as the input for the second command. The program creates a pipeline of two processes, where the output of the first process is connected to the input of the second process.

**Grade: N/A**
