**Grade: 100/100** :trophy:

Printf is a custom implementation of the printf function in C. It includes support for many of the common format specifiers, such as %d, %s, and %f.

### :page_facing_up: Get Next Line
![Get Next Line](.badges/get_next_linem.png)

**Grade: 125/100** :trophy:

Get Next Line is a function that reads lines from a file descriptor. It is useful for reading large files or for reading files that are being updated in real-time.

### :lock: Born2beRoot
![B2BRoot](.badges/born2berootm.png)

**Grade: 125/100** :trophy:

Born2beRoot is a system administration project that involves setting up a virtual machine and configuring various system settings. It includes tasks such as setting up a firewall, configuring network settings, and setting up user accounts.

### :wrench: Pipex
![Pipex](.badges/pipexe.png)

**Grade: 100/100** :trophy:

Pipex is a sophisticated program that emulates the shell command pipeline's functionality. It ingeniously accepts two file names and two commands along with their arguments. The output from the initial command serves as the input for the subsequent command, creating a seamless pipeline between two processes.

### :joystick: So_Long
![So_Long](.badges/so_longe.png)

**Grade: Not graded yet** :hourglass:

So_Long is a 2D game project. It involves creating a basic 2D game using the minilibx, a simplified graphics library. The project focuses on basic game mechanics and rendering techniques.

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Push_Swap
![Push_Swap](.badges/push_swape.png)

**Grade: 100/100** :trophy:

Push_Swap is a sorting algorithm project. The task is to sort stacks of integers using a limited set of instructions, with the goal of doing it in as few moves as possible. The project emphasizes algorithmic efficiency and optimization.
